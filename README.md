# reactive
 
Reactive is an alchemy-themed magic mod based on in-world experimentation. 
If you're here, you're either curious about the source code, or want to know the format for recipes.
Either way, this is a passion project but I tried to put in work to make it understandable at least. 

For recipes, check src/main/resources/data/reactive/recipes for folders full of example recipes for dissolve (Power Release) and transmutation reactions.
